 The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning project designed to recommend movies to users based on their search.
 It recommends similar types of movies to users based on their searched movie 

 The ML model leverages textual data such as movie genre, overview, keywords, top 3 cast, and director to make recommendations. Employed 
 NLTK for data pre-processing and utilized CountVectorizor from Scikit-learn to convert tags into
 vector format, before further computation and analysis.

 Then used streamlit to create website for the model where we can search movies and it will return similar movies to us.
